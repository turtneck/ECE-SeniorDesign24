For my capstone I worked on a team of four to make a robot design to pick up debris on a runway using a NVIDIA Jetson Orin for decision making and ML processing, MEGA 2560 Arduino for Bluetooth and motor controls, Rebel T6i DSLR Camera for Telescopic Imaging, and Carnegie Robotic's MultiSense KS21i Stereo Camera for Relative Positioning.

I contributed
- Computer Vision including the ML models and the Stereo Vision with depth, relative angle, and relative positioning of a detected object
- Robust Software Architecture with comprehensive console printouts and supportive of switching to "fake" versions of unneeded module in current state of experimentation
- Jetson Orin including Linux services, scripting, SSH communication, and general integration
- Integration of DSLR webcam
- Integration of the Stereo camera including ROS2 architecture
- Serial Communication between Jetson and Arduino
- Numerous test scripts with adjustable keyboard inputs to maximize efficiency
