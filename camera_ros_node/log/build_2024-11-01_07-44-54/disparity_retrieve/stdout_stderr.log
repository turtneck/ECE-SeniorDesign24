[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findopencv-python.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "opencv-python", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "opencv-python"
  with any of the following names:

    opencv-pythonConfig.cmake
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
See also "/home/jetson/camera_ros_node/build/disparity_retrieve/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log".
    opencv-python-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "opencv-python" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "opencv-python_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "opencv-python" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
